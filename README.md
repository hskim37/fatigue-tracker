# Fatigue Tracker

## Problem statement
Remote learning and working entails reading digital content for hours daily, with the same schedule repeated endlessly. Inevitably, this situation causes people to lose track of their own fatigue levels and physical presence, leading to unhealthy cycles of overwork, underperformance, and chronic emotional stress.

How might we improve users’ awareness of their fatigue levels during reading-heavy activities and increase productivity? Automatically track and detect user fatigue levels during reading activities? Re-engage individuals with their physical surroundings to prevent extended inactivity? Add delight in interactions?

## Conceptual design

Persona

Jamie is college junior one month into her second semester of remote learning. On top of lengthy class sessions, Jamie has to complete reading-heavy tasks on her laptop since she no longer has access to a physical library. Jamie finds herself stuck to her laptop at all waking hours but still ends up very disappointed with her productivity every day. Jamie’s approach of using sheer willpower to get work done seems to be running her into a wall.
